This Python script is very clear in what its supposed to do.

1) import random 
This is a library to generate random numbers
In bash , you can use the RANDOM env variable 
2)

Code:
NTRIALS = 10000
matches = 0

For these, they are the same as declaring shell variables
3)

Code:
for trial in range(NTRIALS): # Do a bunch of trials...
    taken = {} 
    for person in range(NPEOPLE): 
        day = random.randint(0, 365) 
        if day in taken:
            matches += 1 
            break # No need to look for more than one.
        taken[day] = 1

range(NTRIALS) will give you a range of values from 0 to 9999
so for trial in range(NTRIALs) is a for loop to generate these numbers. So this for loop will iterate 10000 times, starting from count 0.
matches+=1 is the same as matches = matches + 1, which in shell, you can use something like this (or other methods)

Code:
x=`echo "$x + 1" | bc`

taken = {} declares a dictionary, or a lookup table.
random.randint(0,365) will generate a random number in the range from 0 to 365. taken[day] = 1 means keep that random day number in the dictionary
with the value of 1. 
taken will now contain for example:

Code:
taken = { 102:1 } # 102 generated from random.randint()
